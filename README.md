# ATPRO_HCNN
Implementation of two new versions of Hierarchical convolutional neural networks. 
These two versions have as upgrades: Implementation of hard attention and Uncertainty Estimation.

This implementatios were built on top of the architechture HD-CNN implemented by Zhicheng Yan et. al 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736)
